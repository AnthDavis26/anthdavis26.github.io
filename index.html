          <p>
            Hello! I'm Anthony Davis, a Computer Science graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree. I graduated from California State University Monterey Bay in 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to Covid-19 restrictions, I was unable to obtain any internships. Eventually, I worked for over a year with a very prominent tech giant. Due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot disclose who my client was. But if you'd like more details, please check my resume or my employment history. Or go ahead and <a href="./contact.html">contact me!</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment, I'm seeking work as a software engineer. As a lifelong gamer, my dream is to develop video games. It's why I majored in computer science in the first place. I'm open to internships and apprenticeships! I'm malleable and eager to learn and work hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope you enjoy your stay!
